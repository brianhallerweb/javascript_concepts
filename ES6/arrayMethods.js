// array helpers
// forEach
// map
// filter
// find
// every
// some
// reduce
// Before ES6, people used lodash for these array helper methods

// condensing array helpers
// every, some, and reduce
// These methods condense an array down to a single value
// every() checks if every value in an array passes a test and returns a boolean
// some() checks if some value in an array passes a test and returns a boolean
// Reduce is hard to describe but you understand it pretty well. One thing you
//frequently forget is that you always have to return something in the callback.
