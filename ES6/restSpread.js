// rest and spread operators
// these are more syntactic sugar

// the rest operator looks like this
// ...numbers
// when you use that as a parameter it means to take everything passed as an argument and put it all in to an array called numbers

// the spread operator looks the same as the rest operator except for it is used to flatten an array, meaning that it takes the elements out of an array
// a good use of this is the concatenation of arrays

// in short, when you see ... it either means take a bunch of values and put them into an array or it means take a bunch of elements out of an array
