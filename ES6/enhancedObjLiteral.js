// enhanced object literals
// this is just syntactic sugar for succinct objects
// if a key and a value are identical, you just have to use the key and value word once,
// if a value is a function, you don't have to write key: function(){}. Instead, you can just give the function a name and omit the colon. So you just write functionName(){...}
// A place where you see both these techniques is in react.
